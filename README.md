# Controlled vocabularies for MiMoText

As part of the project ["Mining and Modeling Text"](https://www.mimotext.uni-trier.de/en) project (University Trier, Germany), several controlled vocabularies have been created. When generating statements, these are used to standardise information from different sources, to make it queryable and comparable.
[Here](https://github.com/MiMoText/ontology/blob/main/Modules%20overview.md#module-9-terminology) you can have a look at the module "terminology", which defines the modelling of the vocabularies in our ontology.

## Thematic vocabulary

The thematic vocabulary is a controlled vocabulary for assigning topics to thematic concepts. It is used to create thematic statements and feed them into our knowledge graph.

The base is a list of terms from the Dictionnaire européen des Lumières, which is supplemented by thematic keywords from the Bibliographie du genre romanesque français and thematic keywords identified during the manual annotation of the secondary literature.
